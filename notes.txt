MCDEX:
======
Preparation for settlements:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Perpetual.clear(perpetual) -> 
    clear(..., msg.sender())
LiquidityPoolModule.clear(pool, peridx, traderAddr) ->
    pay gas reward
    PerpetualModule.clear()
        countMargin (calc total margin)
        removeFromActiveAccounts
        clear(next trader)
    if all traders cleared in perpetual (for us: in pool)
        PerpetualModule.setClearedState -> settleCollateral(perpetual);

actual settlement
------------------------------------------------------------------
Perpetual.sol settle(uint256 perpetualIndex, address trader)
LiquidityPoolModule settle()
    perpetualModule.settle()
        getSettleableMargin
        resetaccount
    withdraw settleable margin: transferFromPerpetualToUser

SOVRYN:
=======
settlePool(liqpool):
    loop through perpetuals
        if emergency 
            clear perpetual
    setRedemptionRate for entire liq pool

Open points:
    - MCDEX pays keeper rewards to traders, otherwise no incentive structure apparent
    - do we need an incentive structure? Maybe not because traders want to unlock their funds
    - added pool state initializing and running in PerpetualManager -> not checked yet that pools are set to isrunning
    - what if perpetuals cleared but not all margin collected. Now another perpetual defaults and 
      we need to recalculate redemption rate --> ok?
    - added SOVLibraryEvents, Settlement
    - note: perpetuals need same collateral currency in pool. however, base and quote can differ!
