 * @notice If the Frankencoin system was a bank, this contract would represent the equity on its balance sheet.

 * of Frankencoin Pool Shares (FPS) tokens. Anyone can mint additional FPS tokens by adding Frankencoins to the
 * reserve pool. Also, FPS tokens can be redeemed for Frankencoins again after a minimum holding period.
 * Furthermore, the FPS shares come with some voting power. Anyone that held at least 3% of the holding-period-
 * weighted reserve pool shares gains veto power and can veto new proposals.
